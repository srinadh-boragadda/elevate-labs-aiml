What the Project Does : This project implements classification techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical attributes. It leverages Decision Tree and Random Forest models to not only make predictions but also visualize decision paths and analyze feature importance.

Main Goal: -To build interpretable and accurate models for predicting heart disease. -To analyze and visualize how clinical features contribute to the prediction. -To ensure robust and generalizable models using cross-validation.

Tasks Performed :

Data Exploration
Visualization
Data Preprocessing
Model Training & Evaluation
Cross-Validation
Feature Importance
Dataset Used is the Heart Disease Dataset. It contains the features like age, sex, cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, oldpeak, etc..
